## Who am I

I'm a Founding Engineer @ [Awj R&D](https://awjrd.com) and an MSc Computer Science student focused on large language models, AI privacy, and applied ML. 
I design and build LLM-based systems for real-world use, turning research ideas into reliable products. 
I work at the intersection of research, engineering, and early-stage product development. 
I have experience in startup environments where I can build from scratch, validate ideas quickly, and connect research with production systems. 
My current interests include Time-series forecasting, retrieval and reasoning, privacy-preserving AI.
